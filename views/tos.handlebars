    <h2>13. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>In no event shall CincyBrewScene, its officers, directors, employees, or agents, be liable to you for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, punitive, or consequential damages whatsoever resulting from (i) your use or inability to use the software, app, website or our services errors, mistakes, or inaccuracies of content, (ii) any personal injury or property damage, of any nature whatsoever, resulting from your access to and use of our site or service, (iii) any interruption, misinformation, incomplete information, or cessation of transmission to or from our software to you, (iv) any bugs, viruses, trojan horses, or the like, which may be transmitted to or through our site by any third party, (v) any failure of any third party information listed on our site and service, including any failures or disruptions whether intentional or unintentional or (vi) any errors or omissions in our site or service for any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of your use of our site or service, whether based on warranty, contract, tort, or any other legal theory, and whether or not the company is advised of the possibility of such damages. The foregoing limitation of liability shall apply to the fullest extent permitted by law in the applicable jurisdiction.</p>
    <p><strong><em>For Jurisdictions that do not allow us to limit our liability:</em></strong> Notwithstanding any provision of these Terms, if your jurisdiction has provisions specific to waiver or liability that conflict with the above then our liability is limited to the smallest extent possible by law. Specifically, in those jurisdictions not allowed, we do not disclaim liability for: (a) death or personal injury caused by its negligence or that of any of its officers, employees or agents; or (b) fraudulent misrepresentation; or (c) any liability which it is not lawful to exclude either now or in the future.</p>
    <p>If you are a resident of a jurisdiction that requires a specific statement regarding release then the following applies. For example, California residents must, as a condition of this agreement, waive the applicability of California civil code section 1542, which states, “a general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor, you hereby waive this section of the California civil code. You hereby waive any similar provision in law, regulation, or code that has the same intent or effect as the aforementioned release. Your ability to use our software is contingent on your agreement with this and all other sections of this agreement. You agree our total liability to you is not more than $100 US dollars or the total amount you spent while using our site, app, and service within the last six months, whichever is greater.</p>

    <h2>14. Indemnity</h2>
    <p>You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless CincyBrewScene, Inc its officers, directors, employees and agents, from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, and expenses (including but not limited to attorney’s fees) arising from: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>your use of and access to the CincyBrewScene Site and Service;</li>
      <li>your violation of any term of these Terms of Service; </li>
      <li>your violation of any third party right, including without limitation any copyright, property, or privacy right; or </li>
      <li>any claim that any of your Content caused damage to a third party.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This defense and indemnification obligation will survive this Agreement and your use of the CincyBrewScene Service. You also agree that you have a duty to defend us against such claims and we may require you to pay for an attorney(s) of our choice in such cases. You agree that this indemnity extends to requiring you to pay for our reasonable attorneys’ fees, court costs, and disbursements. In the event of a claim such as one described in this paragraph, we may elect to settle with the party/parties making the claim and you shall be liable for the damages as though we had proceeded with a trial.</p>

    <p>At CincyBrewScene we allow users to create Content which is user-generated and respect the fundamental right to speak freely.
